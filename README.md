# Anomaly-Zone
Testing different locus lengths to see how length interacts with anomaly zone

Step 1: Set up phylogenetic model <br>
Step 2: Simulate DNA using ipcoal that corresponds to tree (McKenzie and Eaton) <br>
Step 3: Insert missing data between RAD loci and for allele dropout <br>
Step 4: Save true genealogy <br>
Step 5: Run concatenated DNA phlogenetic analysis to confirm in anomaly zone <br>
Step 6: Use ipyrad analysis tool treeslider to estimate phylogeny.  Find the optimal window size to capture true relationships. <br>
Step 7: Use Robinson-Foulds distance to calculate distance between trees. <br>

_This is a work in progress_
